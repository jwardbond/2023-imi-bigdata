Ashford Cleaners Inc,535 Eglington Avenue W.,Toronto,Ontario,M5N 1B3,Canada,,535 Eglinton Ave. W. ,Toronto,Ontario,"TORONTO, Ont. – September 23, 2013 – Ashford Cleaners Inc., a dry cleaner operating in Toronto, Ontario, was sentenced on August 19, 2013, in the Ontario Provincial Court of Justice for offences under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA, 1999).
Ashford Cleaners Inc. was convicted of contravening the Tetrachloroethylene (Use in Dry Cleaning and Reporting Requirements) Regulations. The offences occurred in July 2012 and included improper storage and containment of tetrachloroethylene waste water and residue. Tetrachloroethylene, also known as perchloroethylene and referred to as PERC, is a commonly used dry cleaning solvent and is designated as a toxic substance under CEPA, 1999.
Ashford Cleaners Inc. was fined $60,000 which is to be paid to the Environmental Damages Fund. As part of a negotiated resolution agreement, the company is required to publish an article regarding the results of their case in a textile industry magazine.
New penalties for offences under CEPA, 1999, were adopted on June 22, 2012. This change impacts individuals and corporations by introducing higher maximum and minimum fines that more accurately reflect the seriousness of environmental offences. Ashford Cleaners Inc. was fined under these new provisions and is one of the first cases in which the new higher minimum fines were imposed.
Tetrachloroethylene is a toxic substance. When it is released, it can cause harm to both the environment and human health. The purpose of the Regulations is to prevent the release of tetrachloroethylene from dry cleaning facilities to the environment by implementing control measures for containing, storing, transporting, selling, recycling, and importing this substance.
The Environmental Damages Fund, administered by Environment Canada, follows the “polluter pays” principle to help ensure that those who cause damage to the environment or harm wildlife habitat take responsibility for their actions. It supports investments in repairing damage to the environment and wildlife habitat.

They also have independent sales agents across Canada as well. Their parent company in the United States, CRC Industries, Inc., is a global leader in the development, production, and distribution of specialty chemicals for the industrial, electrical, automotive, aviation, and marine marketplaces. CRC Canada Co. is the sole distributor/importer for their products in Canada.The file originated from Intel in Prairie and Northern Region (PNR) because Enforcement Officers in PNR conducted an inspection at an Edmonton retail store and found that subsequent sampling of the product “HV Switchgear Lubricant” contained hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), which were in contravention of the Ozone-Depleting Substances Regulations, 1998 (ODSR). HV Switchgear Lubricant is a cleaner and lubricant used for high voltage switches, like utility poles. Since the product was imported and sold by CRC Canada Co. and their head office was located in Mississauga, Ontario, the file was referred to the Ontario Region. On October 29, 2013, EOs conducted an ODSR inspection at CRC Canada Co. and collected 2 samples/cans of HV Switchgear Lubricant for analysis. It was determined that their parent company in the United States, CRC Industries Inc. manufactured the product and CRC Canada Co. solely imported and sold the product to several retailers across Canada from 2011 to 2013. In total, 32 cases (12 cans/case) were imported into Canada but only 23 cases were sold to retailers across Canada. On December 2, 2013 an email was received from the Organic Chemistry Laboratory Technologist at the Prairie and Northern Laboratory for Environmental Testing and the results showed that the product was positive for HCFC-225ca and HCFC-225cb.

Ontario Corporation #119897 conducting buisiness as Cochrane’s Dairy Ltd,3000 Gregoire Road,Russell,Ontario,K4R 1E5,Canada,311 - Food manufacturing,3000 Gregoire Road,Russell,Ontario,"On Thursday August 23, 2012 Enforcement Officer Gordon MOORE (EO MOORE) received a phone call from a citizen informing him of a greyish white plume and a white “slimy, sticky sludge” substance in the Castor River (Russell). The officers conducted an inspection, took samples and determined the substance to be dairy products and caustic cleaning agents from Cochrane’s Dairy. 
EO MOORE issued a Fisheries Inspector’s Direction under the Fisheries Act to stop the wastewater from entering waters frequented by fish. Barry COCHRANE informed EO MOORE that he will temporarily create a sump to collect the wastewater and direct it to the two 12,000L underground tanks already on-site. The tanks would then be pumped by a waste hauler until a permanent solution was attained. 
On November 15, 2012 EO MOORE and EO WALSH returned to the site to verify progress with the Inspector’s Direction. One of the tanks was being emptied into a field next to the Castor River through a sump pump and hose. A greyish discharge was emitting from an underground pipe in the area and draining into the River. Samples were again taken and later proven to be deleterious to fish.

Factors to be considered in the sentencing
Nature of the Environment
It was not necessary to prove harm to the environment, as the cleaning solution would have a negative impact on the vegetation and the fish and other organisms in the river.
The extent of the Injury
The judge did not take into account the several decades of discharging into the river as a factor. This was due to evidence not being presented in court by the witness. The evidence was confined to the sentencing of the offence dates.
Criminality of the Conduct
It is admitted that the discharge of the effluent was not accidental in that the concrete pipe was designed to discharge the effluent from the milk production equipment directly into the river. While Mr. Floyd Cochrane was the president and controlling mind prior to and in August 2012, Mr. Barry Cochrane was a director. As admitted, Mr. Barry Cochrane is responsible for his acquiescence to the direction of his father and for his failure to take steps to ascertain whether or not any of the effluent being pumped into the field in September 20 12, after being warned by Mr. Moore, was finding its way into the river. However, I find that Mr. Barry Cochrane, as a director of the corporation, is also responsible for never inquiring prior to August 2012 when the discharge was discovered, where the wastewater was going. In addition, it is aggravating that Mr. Barry Cochrane not only did not check to see whether the effluent was going into the river in September to November, but that he went along with Mr. Floyd Cochrane's direction or recommendation, in the circumstances. 

The Extent of the Attempts to Comply
I agree that following the initial inspection in August 2012, Cochrane Dairy and specifically Mr. Barry Cochrane took the necessary steps to correct the situation. However, it is again, as stated above, aggravating, in the circumstances, that Cochrane Dairy and Mr. Barry Cochrane went along with Floyd Cochrane's direction to interrupt the proper pumping and transport of the effluent and again, began dumping the effluent in the field, resulting in the effluent being discharged into the field, down the bank and into the Castor River."

On March 27, 2013, EO KENNELL received notification from VALE that a discharge of potentially acute lethal effluent at the Voisey's Bay Mine site on March 26, 2013. Upon the initial discovery, the Tailings and Water Management Coordinator enacted SOP-ML15 (Treated Effluent Pipeline Shutdown) in order to begin preparations for shutdown of the treated effluent pipeline.
The subsequent investigation identified the underlying root causes of this incident according to the report provided by VALE as:
1.The treated effluent system was not dosed with hydrogen peroxide due to miscommunication between the Control Room Operator (CCO) and field personnel. During switch over of peroxide tanks the CCO assumed the manual valve switch over was completed and did not have the reagent operator verify in the field. As a result the peroxide pumps ran dry resulting in damage to the pumps and peroxide not being added to the treatment system.
2.A restoration of the Digital Control System (DCS) server to an older back-up following a failure of the system in late 2012 resulted in the DCS alarms (dosage deviation) and interlocks associated with the peroxide dosing system to be lost. When the peroxide system pumps malfunctioned, and hydrogen peroxide flow stopped, the programmed system alarms did not activate.
3.At the time of the incident the manual checks of peroxide addition were not conducted by the Reagent Operators as per SOP-ML06 (Hydrogen Peroxide Dosing Procedure). This also played a role into the length of time between when the peroxide dosing ceased and was recognized by mill staff (approximately two days).","1 under Subsection 36(3) of Fisheries Act “Vale Newfoundland & Labrador Limited, on or between March 24th, 2013 and March 27th 2013, both days inclusive, did unlawfully deposit a deleterious substance, to wit; acutely lethal effluent as defined in the Metal Mining Effluent Regulations, into water frequented by fish, to wit; Edwards Cove, Anaktalak Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador, in violation of Subsection 36(3) of the Fisheries Act R.S.C. 1985 c.

These tractors were found not to comply with the Off-Road Engine Emission Regulations under CEPA, 1999. The tractors arrive at the Port of Montreal and are picked up by Ian Higginson and taken to his shop in Hawkesbury. From there they are assembled to various degrees i.e. loaders and mufflers installed, as they are shipped unattached. On September 25, 2012 Arie PRILIK submitted a “Canada-Unique” application to import tractors from Minsk, Belarus. Arie PRILIK was informed by VETEV that the submission did not satisfy the requirements of the regulations and that he cannot import the tractors. The application stated that the tractor engines were tested to European emission standards. North American emission standards do not recognize these standards as being equivalent and therefore are invalid. Importation records provided by the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) indicate that MTZ has imported twenty one (21) tractors from the time importing began in February 2011 until March 2013. No exemption notification as outlined in subsection 153(2) of CEPA, 1999 was not provided to TD prior to importation and therefore cannot be granted.

LR Projects Inc.,7314 – 199 Street,Langley,British Columbia,V2Y 1R9,Canada,"417 - Machinery, equipment and supplies merchant wholesalers",18806 96 Avenue,Surrey,British Columbia,"On Thursday, September 26, 2013, Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC), Enforcement Officers (EOs), with the assistance of an Analyst from Environment and Climate Change Canada’s Vehicle and Engines Testing for Emission Verification (VETEV), conducted an on-site inspection of engines imported by LR Projects Inc. (LR), located at a third party warehouse in Surrey, BC. There were 826 engines subject to the Off-Road Small Spark-Ignition Engine Emission Regulations (ORSSIEER) and the Off-Road Compression Ignition Engine Emission Regulations (ORCIEER). Following the inspection, three SSI engines were sampled for testing at ECCC engine testing facility in Ottawa, ON. The remaining engines were seized and detained at the warehouse until LR produced the Evidence of Conformity (EOC) to verify the documentation complied with the regulations. The seized engines were released after LR provided the EOC which demonstrated compliance. Based on the detailed review the information gathered during the inspection, VETEV recommended that samples of the ORCIEER engines be collected for emission testing. EOs returned to PCD at a later date and sampled two engines, a water pump and diesel generator which were equipped with the same engine family. The samples were then sent to VETEV for testing. The test results showed that the ORSSIEER engines conformed to the emissions standards, while the ORCIEER engines failed to conform to the prescribed emissions standards for nitrogen oxides (NOx) and non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC). Upon reviewing the emission test results, the engines manufacturer in China, Fuzhou Launtop M&E Co. Ltd., stated that “… the main problem [with the ORCIEER engines] is the angle of fuel delivery…” and that “It is possible that the angle is not adjusted well by our worker before shipment”, which indicates that the engines have a defect in their construction. Section 157 of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA) requires the importer on becoming aware a defect in the design, construction or functioning of the engine cause a notice of defect (NOD) to the Minster in the prescribed manner. On Several occasions, LR was made aware of the defect and the requirements to come to compliance but LR failed to cause a NOD. In the course of the investigation, it was also discovered that LR failed to submit a declaration to the Minster prior to importation of the ORCIEER engines as required under section 19 of the regulations. On four occasions, between January 2012 and July 2013, LR imported 470 diesel generators and 190 water pumps. On September 24, 2014, ECCC initiated an investigation into LR. On April 12, 2017, LR was charged for failing to submit a declaration and failing to cause NOD to the Minster.",3 counts under s. 19 of ORCIEER and 2 counts under ss. 157 (1) of CEPA.,Canadian company fined after pleading guilty to violations of air pollution thresholds ,https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/environmental-enforcement/notifications/company-violations-air-pollution-thresholds.html,Guilty Plea,2017-09-29,Provincial and Territorial Court,Import of non-compliant products,Not available,"Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA) / Off-Road Compression-Ignition Engine Emission Regulations / s.19, ss.157(1)",2017-09-29,"Vancouver, BC",Penalty for the EDF,"$20,000","On 29 September 2017, before the British Columbia Provincial Court in the City of Vancouver, LR Projects Inc. pleaded guilty of failing to submit a declaration to the Minster before the importation of an engine (Count 2), and failing to cause a NOD to the Minster (Count 4).

Officers conducted an inspection at the property, which they later determined was owned and operated by Shooters Hill Livestock Inc. The officers observed black liquid in a lagoon, a broken culvert, and black liquid covered in white foam flowing away from the culvert and entering a creek. The liquid obscured the natural state of the creek and turned the downstream portion black. The effluent smelled of manure. Manure contains substances such as ammonia, elevated pH, and organics which create oxygen demand, and is a substance deleterious to fish. Samples were collected to determine the chemical composition of the black liquid and to assess its toxicity to fish using multi-concentration rainbow trout acute lethality tests. The samples determined the effluent was lethal to fish even at the lowest concentration of 6.25%. Officers also observed black water further downstream and collected numerous dead fish from the creek.In the subsequent investigation, officers determined that Shooters Hill Livestock was transferring liquid hog manure from a lagoon it was emptying into what was formerly a clean water lagoon for holding purposes. The clean water lagoon had a rotating culvert installed, which collapsed while the transfer was unsupervised, causing liquid hog manure to flow from the lagoon down a draw into Winding Creek and subsequently into Conjuring Creek, which caused a fish kill. A provincial fisheries expert provided a report that concluded Conjuring Creek is very important to the fisheries in the North Saskatchewan River, the release was during spawning season, the chemistry analysis indicates it was toxic to fish, fry, and eggs, and that fisheries management actions were being taken to mitigate the expected reduction in fish populations from the affected 2014 spawning class.Charges were recommended against Shooters Hill Livestock Inc. and its sole director on July 30, 2015.

E/O LAING received a new complaint about Iffy’s Auto Body Parts & Supplies Ltd. in October 2014, alleging that they were importing high VOC automotive refinishing coatings, and then relabeling them with Low VOC information before sale.A reinspection was conducted on March 19th 2015, by E/O LAING. Large numbers of automotive refinishing coatings with VOC levels in excess of the thresholds established in the Regulations were found to be stored in 2266 Drew Road, Unit 11, Mississauga, Ontario. E/O LAING seized the material in the warehouse. Mr. SIDDIQUI confirmed that he does relabel high VOC products. Invoice purchase documents produced by Mr. SIDDIQUI show the importation of many automotive refinishing products above the permitted limits of VOC concentration from a company located in the United States of America.

On June 8th, 2015 E/O LAING received the final lab analysis report for the sampled products. The products which were tested in their final application form were found to be non-compliant with the Regulations. These results confirmed that the VOC content listed on the labels by the US company reflect the actual content of VOC. Charges were laid against Iffy’s Auto Body Parts & Supplies Ltd. on June 12th, 2015. One charge for the import of high VOC content automotive refinishing coatings, and one charge for the sale of those products.

Pointe du Chêne Yacht Club,25 Pointe du Chêne Road,Pointe du Chêne,New Brunswick,E4P 4V7,Canada,,Place of business,Pointe du Chêne,New Brunswick,"MONCTON, N.B. -- February 9, 2012 -- The Pointe du Chêne Yacht Club, in Shediac, New Brunswick, has been fined $6,500 under the Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994, for the destruction of Bank Swallow nests. A guilty plea was entered on the Club’s behalf on February 7th in Provincial Court in Moncton, New Brunswick.
The Court directed that in accordance with the Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994, the $6,500 be placed into the Government of Canada’s Environmental Damages Fund. The Government of Canada recognizes that environmental good must follow environmental harm which is why courts now direct fines to this Fund so communities can repair the actual harm that has been done.
This incident took place on June 9, 2011 and was brought to the attention of Environment Canada by a member of the public who reported that Bank Swallow nests had been destroyed by heavy equipment.
Approximately 40 nests were destroyed when repairs were being made to the breakwater at the Pointe du Chêne Yacht Club that was damaged by storm surge last winter.
The Bank Swallow is a small migratory songbird protected under the Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994.The population of Bank Swallows has been in significant decline since 1980. According to the North American Breeding Bird Atlas, declines have been seen in all regions of Canada and the United States, but are highest in New Brunswick where the population has decreased by nearly 22 per cent per year between 1989 and 2009.
Bank Swallows create burrows and build their nests on vertical or near-vertical banks and bluffs along rivers, lakes and oceans, as well as in sand and gravel pits. They nest in colonies ranging in size from 10 to 2,000 nests. Destruction of their coastal habitat can result in the loss of nests, eggs, chicks, the death of adult birds that are unable to escape from their burrows, and also prevents re-nesting at this site in the future.

In 2011, Elgin Mining Incorporated (""EMI"") became the parent company of LMI. As of April 1, 2018, both EMI and LMI are valid and subsisting corporations.The Lupin Mine is located at 65°45′N 111°15′W in Western Nunavut. It opened in 1982 and ceased production in 2005. It is a formerly active gold mine, which has been under Care and Maintenance Status since stopping production in 2005. This means mining and milling are not taking place at the site.Following the Metal Mining Effluent Regulations, LMI conducted biological studies. They conducted and submitted the first two studies in 2006 and 2009. In 2011, they conducted and submitted a third study, investigated an effect on Arctic Grayling, a species of freshwater fish. Furthermore, it acknowledged that no connection was made between the observed effect and effluent discharge from the mine. Since no confirmed effect was indicated by the third study, LMI was to either continue investigative study or conduct a fourth study. In December 2012, LMI and Environment and Climate Change Canada (“ECCC”) agreed that a fourth study would be completed and submitted in June 2014.In August 2013, LMI advised ECCC that due to financial restraints they would be unable to complete the fourth study on time and sought an extension for completion to June 2015. ECCC reviewed the legislation and practice and advised in response that there was no legislative authority to grant an extension of the study deadline under the Regulations.In September 2013 Mandalay Resources (“Mandalay”) acquired EMI and as a consequence LMI and its attendant filing responsibilities.In March 2014 the Type A Water License issued by the Nunavut Water Board for the Lupin Mine site expired. Without an active license, LMI believed they did not have authorization to use or dispose of water or waste water at the site, which would be required to complete the fourth study. AANDC did give permission to LMI to access the site and complete other works at the site.In the Summer of 2015 LMI did not yet have a license in place. The Nunavut Water Board recommended to the Minister of AANDC that a licence be issued in May 2015. The Minister, citing concern about the quantum of security recommended by the NWB, declined to issue the licence pending further discussion over the amount of security posted for the site. The licence was issued in October 2015.An investigation was initiated in November 2015 for the failure of LMI to file the fourth study report on time. The investigation revealed the primary reason for not completing the EEM study was a lack of funds. LMI was charged with one count under the MMER’s in October 2016.LMI under Mandalay Resources’ oversight and within its duty to comply with ECCC's requirements completed the fourth study during the period June to September 2016. The report was provided to ECCC on June 1, 2017 and receipt was confirmed on June 6, 2017, 36 months after the original deadline. The report confirmed the results of the third study that there were no noted environmental harms to fish or benthic populations from mine related effects.","LMI, on or about the 6th day of June 2014, at or near the Lupin Mine Site in the Territory of Nunavut failed to conduct environmental effects monitoring studies, in accordance with the requirements, and within the periods set out in Schedule 5, contrary to section 7(1) of the Metal Mining Effluent Regulations SOR/2002-222. thereby committing an offence under section 78 of the Fisheries Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.

Operators discussed possible causes and contacted a field operator. These alarms were attributed to temperature fluctuations at a location in the SGS unrelated to the failure. The alarms were not immediately reported to supervisory staff, recorded by the operator at the time, nor was SCADA contacted for assistance. There was an incomplete briefing of the alarms given to incoming staff at shift change at 17:45.On 20 July 2016, between 17:30 and 18:00, the evening shift took over monitoring duties in the control room. At 18:30 the operator noted that the LDS was in dual alarm. At 19:10, a request was sent to SCADA for assistance in dealing with the alarms. At 19:30 the operator began filling out a pipeline imbalance checklist documenting the existence of the alarms. SCADA called the control room in response to the help request and advised the operator to contact his supervisor. The designers of the LDS were also contacted to help with troubleshooting. At approximately 21:30, the operator advised his supervisor of the existence of the alarms. At 21:35, field operators were called to physically check some of the new connections for possible leaks, but none were found. SCADA continued their investigation and analysis of the alarms until 23:30 but were unable to determine the cause of the alarms. Although both the operator and the supervisor had the authority to shut down 16TAN due to the alarms, the supervisor advised the operator to continue running and monitoring the pipeline. The alarms continued throughout the shift, which ended at 05:30 on 21 July. Although the cause of the alarms was not conclusively determined, no-one investigating concluded that there was a leak.On 21 July 2016 at 08:25, the Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment (MOE) received a report of a sheen on the River at the Toby Nollet Bridge (the Bridge) on Highway 21, 16km downstream from where it was determined the oil entered the River. At 08:30, MOE reported the sheen to the Saskatchewan Ministry of the Economy (ECON). At approximately 08:40 two field staff from ECON's office in Lloydminster were dispatched to the Bridge to investigate the source of the sheen. They arrived on site around 09:35 and confirmed there was a significant amount of oil on the River.On 21 July 2016 at 08:45, Husky was informed by a third party of a possible sheen on the River and began to investigate. At 09:45, a Husky field operator was told by a third party operator that oil was observed in the River near the Bridge. At 10:00, Husky contacted ECON to advise of the location of the leak being a pipeline crossing under the River, but it was unclear whether the source was a Husky pipeline or an adjacent pipeline owned and operated by another company. Despite not knowing the source of the leak, Husky established an emergency operations centre to respond to the release as if it was theirs, or to assist other operators whose operations may have been the source. At 10:05, operators were informed of a pipeline leak and at 10:07, they closed the River crossing valves on 16TAN and initiated Husky's emergency response plan.Post-incident studies determined that on 20 July 2016 at around 15:00, 16TAN cracked at the failure location, about 160m south of the River crossing, resulting in the spill of blended crude oil. An estimated 225,000L (+/-10%) of product leaked into the environment until 16TAN was shut down at 08:15 on 21 July for previously scheduled maintenance. It is estimated that about 40% of the leaked product entered the waters of the River.","Count 1: That on or between 20 July 2016 and 21 July 2016, did deposit or permit the deposit of a deleterious substance, namely blended heavy crude oil, in water frequented by fish or in a place where the deleterious substance may enter water frequented by fish, namely the North Saskatchewan River near Maidstone, Saskatchewan, contrary to subsection 36(3) of the Fisheries Act, RSC 1985 c F-14¸ thereby committing an offense contrary to subsection 40(2) of the Fisheries Act, RSC 1985 c F-14.Count 9: That on or between 20 July 2019 and 21 July 2019, did deposit or permit the deposit of a substance that is harmful to migratory birds, namely blended heavy crude oil, in waters or in an area frequented by migratory birds or in a place from which the substance may enter such water or such are, near Maidstone, Saskatchewan, contrary to subsections 5.1.(1) of the Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994, SC 1992, c. 22 thereby committing an offense contrary to subsection 13(1) of the Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994, SC 1992, c. 22.",Husky Oil Operations Limited fined $2.7 million for federal offences related to the pipeline release of oil into the North Saskatchewan River,https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/news/2019/06/husky-oil-operations-limited-fined-27-million-for-federal-offences-related-to-the-pipeline-release-of-oil-into-the-north-saskatchewan-river.html,Guilty Plea,2019-06-12,Provincial and Territorial Court,Allowed the deposit of a deleterious substance|Other,Allowed the deposit of a substance harmful to migratory birds,"Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994 /  / 5.1.(1)|Pollution Prevention provisions (subsection 36(3)) of the Fisheries Act /  / ",2019-06-12,"Lloydminster, Saskatchewan",Penalty for the EDF,"$2,700,000","On 12 June 2019, before the Provincial Court of Saskatchewan in Lloydminster, Saskatchewan, Husky Oil Operations Limited pleaded guilty to one count under subsection 36(3) of the Fisheries Act, RSC 1985 c F-14 and one count under subsection 5.1(1) of Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994, SC 1992, c. 22.On the same day, Husky Oil Operations Limited was ordered by the Provincial Court to pay a total of $2,700,000.00 in federal fines to the Environmental Damages Fund (“EDF”).

Canadian National Railway Company (CN),935 de la Gauchetiere Street West,Montreal,Quebec,H3B 2M9,Canada,482 - Rail transportation,CN Skeena subdivision ,between the City of Terrace and City of Prince Rupert ,British Columbia,"CN operates rail lines, of approximately 94.6 miles in length, between Terrace and Prince Rupert, B.C. known as the Skeena Subdivision. Between August 24 and 28, 2017, Wilderness Environmental Services (WES) conducted spray application of herbicides in the CN Skeena subdivision on behalf of CN as part of CN’s vegetation management program.
On August 28, 2017, EED Enforcement Officers observed the discharge of a mist from spray booms on the front and rear of a WES spray truck, as it travelled along the CN Skeena Subdivision rail tracks that run parallel to the Skeena River. A sample of the sprayed substance was collected from the spray nozzle of the WES spray truck. Laboratory analysis of the sampled substance determined that it contained 900 parts per million of imazapyr, which is acutely lethal to fish at full strength and when diluted with water at 2% concentration. Subsequent sampling of sediment and impacted vegetation at eight locations sprayed by WES in the CN Skeena Subdivision, detected active ingredients of herbicide formulations namely imazapyr, metsulfuron-methyl, glyphosate and aminopyralid in close proximity to fish bearing waters. The concentrations of the herbicide formulations, containing the aforementioned active ingredients, were found to be deleterious to fish when added to water, deposited in water frequented by fish, or in a place under conditions where the substance may enter such water, at five of the locations sampled. No dead or harmed aquatic organisms, fish or other organisms were found as a result of the herbicide spraying in the CN Skeena Subdivision. However, the Skeena River and its’ tributaries are considered to be a globally significant ecosystem and portions of the CN Skeena Subdivision rail lines cross, or are adjacent to, environmentally sensitive areas, including many fish bearing water bodies. The Skeena River estuary contains rich habitats for many species of fish and wildlife, and its’ mudflats and shallow intertidal passages provide a nursery habitat for juvenile salmon that travel through the estuary as they migrate out to sea.","In August 2021, the Company was charged with One count of depositing a deleterious substance into fish bearing waters (FA36(3))",Canadian National Railway Company fined $2.5 million for Fisheries Act Offence,https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/environmental-enforcement/canadian-national-railway-company-fined-fisheries-act-offence.html,Guilty Plea,2021-09-15,Provincial and Territorial Court,Allowed the deposit of a deleterious substance,,Pollution Prevention provisions (subsection 36(3)) of the Fisheries Act /  / 36(3),2021-09-15,"Prince Rupert, B.C.

Box 5000,Elkford,British Columbia,V0B 1H0,Canada,212 - Mining and quarrying (except oil and gas),Teck Coal Limited (Fording River Operations) and Teck Coal Limited (Greenhills Operations),Elford,British Columbia,"A comprehensive investigation was conducted by Environment and Climate Change Canada, which revealed that Teck Coal Limited’s operations were depositing deleterious coal mine waste rock leachate into the upper Fording River. In 2012, this leachate from Teck Coal Limited’s Fording River Operations and Greenhills Operations coal mines deposited selenium and calcite into the upper Fording River.
During the investigation, under the authority of a warrant, enforcement officers captured Westslope Cutthroat Trout in the upper Fording River and some of its tributaries. Environment and Climate Change Canada’s laboratory analysis determined that some of the fish captured contained selenium concentrations at levels that can be linked with adverse effects in fish. Officers also identified calcite deposits in the upper Fording River and some of its tributaries that had caused a hardening of the riverbeds that can affect the quality of the fish habitat.
Following the investigation, Environment and Climate Change Canada officers had reasonable grounds to believe that Teck Coal Limited had not taken all reasonable measures, consistent with public safety, and with the conservation and protection of fish and fish habitat as required by s. 38(6) of the Fisheries Act, and that immediate action was necessary to prevent and mitigate any detrimental effects.
Consequently, on October 29, 2020, Environment and Climate Change Canada issued a Direction. The measures required by the Direction are aimed at preventing the discharge of deleterious substances and mitigating the adverse effects of selenium and calcite deposits to help protect the Westslope Cutthroat Trout population in the upper Fording River.
On March 24, 2021, following settlement discussions between PPSC and Teck’s Counsel, 2 charges under section 36(3) of the Fisheries Act were laid in relation to this matter related to deleterious discharges in the Fording River and Clode Pond. The charges were laid by way of Indictment.
On March 26, 2021, following Teck entering a guilty plea to the 2 Fisheries Act counts, and upon the judge receiving a joint submission on the penalty, Teck was sentenced to a penalty of $60 million. Of the $60 million penalty, $2 million is a fine, and $58 million is a monetary penalty payable to the Environmental Damages Fund.

The Tree Swallow is a migratory bird pursuant to the Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994. The boxes were discovered on the ground that evening by members of the public. The following morning, EllisDon’s site supervisor learned what had happened and contacted their environmental consultant. The consultant confirmed there were thirteen bird boxes in total and that six, possibly seven, were active with Tree Swallows. The boxes were subsequently reattached to their fence posts.

An onsite inspection was conducted by Environment and Climate Change Canada Wildlife Officers. It was confirmed that EllisDon did not hold a valid permit to disturb the nest shelters of migratory birds. This was a violation of section 6(a) of the Migratory Birds Regulations which is an offence under Section 13 of the Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994.

On February 26, 2019, Teck Metals Ltd. filed a Dangerous Goods Incident Report (DGIR 184344). Teck reported an ongoing release of acidic solution at the Teck Trail (Fertilizer Operations) in Warfield, B.C. The acidic solution entered the Combined IV (C-IV) sewer outfall. The material was initially flowing at 14m³ per minute with an estimated discharged volume of 2461 m³ (2,461,000 liters) of effluent below a pH of 4.2.

The effluent from the C-IV line discharges into the Columbia River. The acidic solution should have been discharged into the recently constructed C-IV Retention/Holding Ponds, which were constructed following a 2016 court resolution where Teck Metals plead guilty to 3 Fisheries Act 36(3) counts, and agreed to undertake 7 projects to prevent future deleterious discharges. The C-IV Retention/Holding Ponds were 1 of the 7 projects. Numerous operational errors led to the effluent in this incident not being diverted to the C-IV Retention/Holding Ponds, and instead being discharged into the Columbia River.

The discharged effluent also failed a LC50 test, which violated a condition of their provincial operating permit.

On August 22, 2017, Michels Canada Co. was the head contractor responsible for horizontal directional boring operations in Coquitlam, BC. During drilling operations Michels Canada Co. failed to identify a storm drain connection adjacent to the construction area, and drilling fluid and sediment-laden waters were released through the storm sewer system into Cape Horn Creek. Twenty dead fish were found in the creek following the release.

Quibble Creek Incident:
On September 2, 2017, Michels Canada Co. was carrying out horizontal directional boring operations in Surrey, BC. During drilling operations, drilling fluid and sediment-laden waters were released through a storm sewer system into Quibble Creek. It was estimated that a discharge of approximately 1600 litres entered Quibble Creek through the storm sewer system.

Approximately 533 dead fish were found in the creek following the release.

Cape Horn Creek and Quibble Creek form part of the Fraser River Estuary. This estuary contains rich habitat for many species of fish and wildlife. The estuary’s marshes support millions of migrating salmon at a critical stage in their early development, before they migrate out to sea, and act as a staging area for adult upstream spawning migration. The Fraser River estuary is a globally significant ecosystem.

Specifically, both Cape Horn Creek and Quibble Creek support fish of economic, social, and cultural importance. The presence of Cutthroat trout in Quibble creek, a species at risk and of special concern, emphasizes the need for the protection of this creek and its supporting habitat.

Both Cape Horn Creek and Quibble Creek are recognised for their biological importance and have been given the highest rating for protection;designated Class A (red) watercourses, meaning that they are inhabited by salmonids year-round and have potential to support many species of fish.","Count 1

Collingwood Prime Realty Holdings Corp.,"480 University Avenue, Suite #1401",Toronto,Ontario,M5G 1V2,Canada,551 - Management of companies and enterprises,"480 University Avenue, Suite #1401",Toronto,Ontario,"On August 16, 2013, ECCC officers conducted an on-site inspection at 101 Mountain Road, Collingwood, ON. ECCC officers discovered two transformers and eight capacitors that bore safety marks indicating that they contained Askarel and Ineerteen, generic names used to classify a broad range of fluids that commonly contain polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in a concentration of 400,000 – 700,000 mg/kg PCBs. This is approximately 1,000 times the legal limit allowed in Canada of 500 mg/kg for equipment containing PCBs. Collingwood Prime Realty Holdings Corp. (CPRHC) owned the PCBs at 101 Mountain Road. 

On November 7, 2013, a written warning was issued to CPRHC notifying them of their obligations under the PCB Regulations and the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA) in regard to removing the equipment and sending it away for destruction.

On September 8, 2014, ECCC officers conducted another on-site inspection of the property to follow-up with the written warning to see if the equipment had been removed. During the inspection, the two transformers and eight capacitors were still present.

On September 19, 2014, CPRHC was issued an environmental protection compliance order (EPCO) to have the equipment removed by February 7, 2015. Based on information provided to CPRHC from an electrical contractor the removal and replacement of the equipment could not take place until the first quarter of 2015. ECCC officers took this into consideration and chose to follow-up with the EPCO after the first quarter of 2015.

On April 28, 2015, CPRHC informed the lead ECCC officer that the equipment was not removed.

On April 30, 2015, the lead ECCC case officer informed CPRHC that he was commencing an investigation. The investigation involved obtaining records from various sources and obtaining samples from the two transformers. The investigation revealed that the property was owned and controlled by CPRHC and confirmed that at least one of the transformers was in-use between October 30, 2013 and August 31, 2015. Analysis of the samples collected confirmed both transformers contained PCBs in a concentration greater than 500 mg/kg.
